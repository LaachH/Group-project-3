Part of our assignment was to analyze the real average value per room across a group of inner city Melbourne suburbs. This analysis gave us the top 30 and bottom 30 suburbs ranked at a cost per room. The price per room in the most expensive suburb was $750km per room vs $420k in the lower suburbs. It is worth noting that the expensive suburbs typically have a higher number of bedrooms. So whilst the room price range doesnt spread as much as one would expect. The room count increases, the fancier the suburb.
